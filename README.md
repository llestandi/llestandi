Hi, I’m Lucas, associate professor (MCF) at Ecole Centrale Nantes, France

I use this github mostly for storing my research and teaching work. Occasionnaly, I'll make the repos that deserve it public.

## Research Topics:
I mostly focus on the following aspects 
 - Reduced Order Modeling (intrusive)
 - Surrogate modeling (non-intrusive)
 - Machine Learning for science
 - POD/SVD
 - Dimension reduction
 - tensor decomposition 

With various application fields e.g.
 - Complex flows
 - Additive manufacturing of metals (laser powder bed fusion)
 - etc.

## Teaching : 
I'm teaching in the department of computer science. I heavily rely on jupyter notebooks that I store here for the following courses:
 - Databases
 - Algorithmic and C++ programming
 - Advanced python
 - Data visualization
 - ...
